\title{Defintion of the regions with Bayes factor over a threshold.}
\usage{
fine_map(res, lev_res, thresh, start, end, chr)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{Output of mWaveQTL.}

\item{lev_res}{the maximum level of resolution of the previous analysis.}

\item{thresh}{numeric, Bayes factor threshold to defined the fine mapping. If missing set as 1.}

\item{start}{numeric, start in base pair of the analyzed regions .}

\item{chr}{numeric, end in base pair of the analyzed regions .}
}
\description{
internal function for fine mapping tool for output of the mWaveQTL function.
}
\details{
return a list of chr, start, end position, that correspond of the sub regions defined by the dyadic decomposition of wavelet that are associated with a Bayes factor over the defined threshold.
